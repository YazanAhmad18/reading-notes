 Read: 07 - HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions


## i understand the concept of using table we need some time to display information in table because those information are need to be seen at full ,tables are contain cells ,rows,columns the basic structure of the table is :
* `<table>`:to createthe table
* `<tr>`:to put the table row
* `<td>`:to fill the content inside the table
* `<th>`:it is repersent the row heading of the table
* `<thead>`:head of the table
* `<tbody>`:the body of the table
* `<tfoot>`:the footer of the table
 ### sometime we need the table to be more flexable so we use colspan to merge more than one column together or we can use rowspan to merge more than one row together ,some time the tabels maybe too long so we need to know what is the head of the table and what is the main body and waht is the footer of the table in the bast we could edit the width and height ,border & background of the table inside the html tag but now we replace it in the css 

## js note:
### we can create an objects using  contructor notation through using the new keyword with the object construcor  then we can add the properties or the methods that we want , we can udpate the conent or i mean the value of the property through using dot or square brackets to call the proprety, we can use fucntion to creat an objects and put inside the parentheses , the objects that take the properties from other objects we call them instance , we can add properties through the name of objects and name of the proprety and value of it  and we can delete property , there is two way to create object (LITERAL NOTATION ,OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION ), this keyword that is refer to the objects that inside it , we can store data in variables, we consider the array is object, browser come up with built-in objects like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window ,three groups of objects model (browser of object model, document of object model ,global java script objects) , the first group is working with the windo second one is working with elements the third one is working with data type
