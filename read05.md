# I understood the concept of comparison Operator that we can evaluate the situation by comparing one value in the script  to what you expect might be  the result will be a boolean :true,false
## types logical operator:
* == : equal to this operator compare two values if they are the same
* !=: not equal to this operator compare two values if they are not the same
* === : strict equal to  this operator compare two  values to check that both of the values are the same in the data type and the value
* !== : strict not equal to this operator compare two  values to check that both of the values are not the same in the data type and the value
* (>)  :  greater than this operator check if the number in the left greater than the number in the right
*  < : less than this operator check if the number in the left less than the number in the right
* <= : less than or equal this operator check if the number in the left less than or equal the number in the right
*  (>=) : greater than or equal  this operator check if the number in the left greater than the number in the right

### the the logical operator  allow us to compare the result of more than one comparison operator
### some logical operator:
*  && : and this operator test more than one conditon
*  (||) : or this operator test at least  one condition
*  ! : not this operator take the value of boolean and then inverts it


#### i understant the  concept of the loop is element of code that check the condition  if it ture its will run the code  and it will keep it running as long as the code return the value true to get done the task that code need to be done the loop will stop working when the return value be false there are  three types of loops (for,while,do whlie)

### the structure of the loop:
* initialization
* condition
* update
