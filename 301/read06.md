# What is node.js?
## Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
# In your own words, what is Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine?
## It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
# What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
## It is used for developing applications that make heavy use of the ability to run JavaScript both on the client, as well as on the server side and therefore benefit from the re-usability of code and the lack of context switching.
# What is npm?
## In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world's largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download.
# What version of a node are you running on your machine?
## v14.17.0
# What version of npm are you running on your machine?
## 7.16.0
# What command would you type to install a library/package called 'jshint'?
## npm install -g jshint
# What is a node used for?
## installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won't get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

# How does pair programming work?
##  Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
