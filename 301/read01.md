## the main thing things that the component based on division of the software into functional or logical components that are clear to understand what I mean the component divides the problem into subproblems to make it easy to solve it is very useful that reduce the time and money and increase the reliability.

## the component is a module that contains function or properties or any script of code the preform task  can be replaceable, and reusable also you can consider component as a software object that interacts with other components

## there are some Characteristics for the component such as :
* Reusability: that means we can call the component and reuse it   somewhere else in the software
* Replaceable: that means if other components do the same task in less time and code we can replace the component 
* Not context-specific: that means the component can contain more than the type of context such properties or methods or whatever the software want 
* Extensible: that mean component can give their properties and function to other components to use it 
* Encapsulated: means that the component shows the user how the function is done without going into details inside of it
* Independent:that means if one component broke down does not mean the other component well broke down 

## there are some Advantages to using it:
* Ease of deployment: mean can replace it or fix anything in it without making a lot of problems 
* Reduced cost: for sure because the components divide the software it will make it  flexible so in this way will reduce the money for the maintenance

* Ease of development: that mean we can develop any component in the software without impact to other components

* Reusable :that means we can use the component more than once at the system or we can use it in other systems

* Modification of technical complexity: that mean the component reduce the complexity of the software because divide it into more than one component

* Reliability : that means the script of code or properties or function or whatever inside the method are clear and good to understand  without any complexity this will make it reliable

* System maintenance and evolution: easy to change or update any component

* Independent : each component does not affect or impact on any other components 

## What is props short for?
### props: is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

## How are props used in React?
### we can use props in react first define an attribute  and what it is value then we pass it to child component then render the props data

## What is the flow of props?
### props are being passed in a uni-directional flow
