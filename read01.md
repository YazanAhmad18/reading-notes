### I understood that the concept of a text editor is a program that we can write on and manage with text  and there is no better text editor ever every editor has certain features  you have to choose the text editor you want and the text editor depends on the software on your computer and also the text editor contains things to help you like complete the words for you I also understood the meaning of terminal or command Line  It is a place where we put the commands in writing and it is easy to use and there are many commands that can be written and there are some great commands such as the command that I can know in any directory I am now or moving between files or creating a file or deleting a file or viewing existing files and I have learned about some characteristics In the Linux system, it does not care much about the extension of the file  but looks at the inside of the information in the file and also there can be two files with the same name, but with different letters, such as the first file all letter small but second one contain  large letter that mean linux is not case sensitive, unlike the Windows system ,there are also many shortcuts in the Linux system to make things easier
