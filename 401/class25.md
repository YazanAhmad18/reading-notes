## Docker
Docker is an open source platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications. Learn about containers, how they compare to VMs, and why Docker is so widely adopted and used.
### What is Docker?
Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containers—standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment. Containers simplify delivery of distributed applications, and have become increasingly popular as organizations shift to cloud-native development and hybrid multicloud environments.

Developers can create containers without Docker, but the platform makes it easier, simpler, and safer to build, deploy and manage containers. Docker is essentially a toolkit that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update, and stop containers using simple commands and work-saving automation through a single API.

Docker also refers to Docker, Inc. (link resides outside IBM), the company that sells the commercial version of Docker, and to the Docker open source project (link resides outside IBM), to which Docker, Inc. and many other organizations and individuals contribute.

### Why use Docker?
Docker is so popular today that “Docker” and “containers” are used interchangeably. But the first container-related technologies were available for years — even decades (link resides outside IBM) — before Docker was released to the public in 2013. 

Most notably, in 2008, LinuXContainers (LXC) was implemented in the Linux kernel, fully enabling virtualization for a single instance of Linux. While LXC is still used today, newer technologies using the Linux kernel are available. Ubuntu, a modern, open-source Linux operating system, also provides this capability.

Docker enhanced the native Linux containerization capabilities with technologies that enable:

- Improved—and seamless—portability: While LXC containers often reference machine-specific configurations, Docker containers run without modification across any desktop, data center and cloud environment.
- Even lighter weight and more granular updates: With LXC, multiple processes can be combined within a single container. With Docker containers, only one process can run in each container. This makes it possible to build an application that can continue running while one of its parts is taken down for an update or repair.
- Automated container creation: Docker can automatically build a container based on application source code.
- Container versioning: Docker can track versions of a container image, roll back to previous versions, and trace who built a version and how. It can even upload only the deltas between an existing version and a new one.
- Container reuse: Existing containers can be used as base images—essentially like templates for building new containers.
- Shared container libraries: Developers can access an open-source registry containing thousands of user-contributed containers.


### Install Docker
Docker Compose is an additional tool that is automatically included with Mac and Windows downloads of Docker. However if you are on Linux, you will need to add it manually. You can do this by running the command ```sudo pip install ``` 
docker-compose after your Docker installation is complete.


To confirm Docker installed correctly we can run our first command docker run hello-world





## Django for APIs

* Django REST Framework works alongside the Django web framework to create web APIs. We cannot build a web API with only Django Rest Framework; it always must be added to a project after Django itself has been installed and configured.

* In this chapter we will review the similarities and differences between traditional Django and Django REST Framework. The most important takeaway is that Django creates websites containing webpages, while Django REST Framework creates web APIs which are a collection of URL endpoints containing available HTTP verbs that return JSON.

* To illustrate these concepts, we will build out a basic Library website with traditional Django and then extend it into a web API with Django REST Framework.


## Linux Containers

- Docker is really just Linux containers which are a type of virtualization.

- Virtualization has its roots at the beginning of computer science when large, expensive mainframe computers were the norm. How could multiple programmers use the same single machine? The answer was virtualization and specifically virtual machines which are complete copies of a computer system from the operating system on up.

- If you rent space on a cloud provider like AWS they are typically not providing you with a dedicated piece of hardware. Instead you are probably sharing a physical server with hundreds or even thousands of other clients.

- What’s the downside to a virtual machine? Size and speed. A typical guest operating system can easily take up 700MB of size. So if one physical server supports three virtual machines, that’s at least 2.1GB of disk space taken up along with separate needs for CPU and memory resources.
## Containers vs Virtual Environments

- If you are a Python programmer (like me) a common question at this point is, what about virtual environments? How do they differ from containers?

- Virtual environments are used to isolate Python software packages locally. We can create an isolated box for individual projects so one can use Python 2.7 and Django 1.5 while another can use Python 3.5 and Django 2.1 on the same computer. Virtual environments are great.

- But…virtual environments can only isolate Python packages. They still rely on a global, system-level installation of Python albeit they can refer to the proper version. So when we use Python 2.7 in a project, we’re pointing to an installation of Python 2.7 on the computer itself, not actually within the virtual environment.

- Also we can’t run a production database or other services within virtual environments so compared to Docker containers they are far more limited.
