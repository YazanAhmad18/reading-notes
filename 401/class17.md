# How to Web Scrape with Python in 4 Minutes


**Web Scraping**

* Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort. In this article, we will go through an easy example of how to automate downloading hundreds of files from the New York MTA. This is a great exercise for web scraping beginners who are looking to understand how to web scrape. Web scraping can be slightly intimidating, so this tutorial will break down the process of how to go about the process.


***Important notes about web scraping:***


1. Read through the website’s Terms and Conditions to understand how you can legally use the data. Most sites prohibit you from using the data for commercial purposes.


2. Make sure you are not downloading data at too rapid a rate because this may break the website. You may potentially be blocked from the site as well.


**Inspecting the Website**
The first thing that we need to do is to figure out where we can locate the links to the files we want to download inside the multiple levels of HTML tags. Simply put, there is a lot of code on a website page and we want to find the relevant pieces of code that contains our data. If you are not familiar with HTML tags, refer to W3Schools Tutorials. It is important to understand the basics of HTML in order to successfully web scrape.
On the website, right click and click on “Inspect”. This allows you to see the raw code behind the site.


## Web Scraping

- Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or through a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.

- Web scraping is used for contact scraping, and as a component of applications used for web indexing, web mining and data mining, online price change monitoring and price comparison, product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring, website change detection, research, tracking online presence and reputation, web mashup and, web data integration.

- Web pages are built using text-based mark-up languages (HTML and XHTML), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form. However, most web pages are designed for human end-users and not for ease of automated use. As a result, specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages.

- Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the semantic web vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and human-computer interactions. Current web scraping solutions range from the ad-hoc, requiring human effort, to fully automated systems that are able to convert entire web sites into structured information, with limitations.
