# Read: 05 - HTML Images; CSS Color & Text



## I understood why images are used in websites, perhaps the website logo or a picture expressing an explanation or using pictures to avoid explanation in words. When we want to use images on sites, the image must have a relationship in the topic, have appropriate color, and be clear with regard to the audience and the correct use of images. Is to create a file within the project and put all the pictures in it so that things are organized. The images can be detailed by placing each group of images inside the appropriate file for them until the pictures are added, we must add tag image:
## Vthe structure for the image:
* `<img>`:it is the tag of the image
* src: we put this attribute inside the image tag to determine the path of the image
* alt:that is mean what is going on to show if the image doesnot appaer
* title:we add this to give title to the image

### there is an attributes that can control the height and width of the image to make picture look great in the website and for sure we can control the place of the image  but we want to be careful where are we going to place because there is other element can affect on the place there is an attribute call align it allows us to  put it to the left or right but this attribute is no longer work we can change it through css and we can change it up down and middle
### there are three rules of putting image inside the website:
* Save images in the right format
* Save images at the right size
* Use the correct resolution
### we can use adope photoshop to edit image as much we want  there is more than one format to the images (gif,jpeg,jpg) we can do alot of thing to the image such change the shape and playing with the size or cropping it , we have to make sure and check the resolution,there is many types of image is normal and vector ,animated we can aslo make the images tarnsparent  there is tag that allow us to contain the image and caption for it call figure,figcaption)
 

### i understand the benefit of the color it make the website more nice and easy to see conent and give the site veiw,every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue there is type of ways that we can add color to the website:
* rgb values
* hex codes
* color names
#### we can add color for manything such as background,foregournd when we want to chose any color for background color or foreground we have to make sure that colors Contrast to read the text,color pickers can help you find the color you want.

## opacity:property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements 
## hsl:olor property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors the element in inside the hls:
* hue:its color that we want to chose
* saturation:the amount of the grey in the color 
* lightness:Lightness is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color
* alpha:is the opacity
 
### there are many attributes and that allow you to control the text,there is ,such the type of font(Serif ,Sans-Serif,Monospace,Cursive),weight of the font,style font,stretch the font,size of the font.
