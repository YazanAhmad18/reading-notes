# Read: 14a - CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations


## there are new ways to position the element what I mean there is new techniques that are made  to edit the position  such as transform property, the transform property has to types the first one is two-dimensional and the second one is three-dimensional for sure the transform property is getting better day by day, even the syntax of this property is very easy just keyword of it then the value, for transform, there are more than one vendor prefixes  just to make sure to provide the best support for browser, let's talk about  two-dimensional transform work on the x and y axes but the three-dimensional transform work on three axises on the property of transform we have the 2d rotate  to some rotation to the element on the two axises the rotate work on the degree, we have other thing call scale this will manage the size of the element the scale work we put parentheses inside it numbers, also there is the translate is working to move the elements on both axises or on of them  it works when we put inside parentheses numbers with pixels,skew transform , skew, is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both ,skew works with degrees , the most good thing is that we can  combine more than one transform together , the normal transform is working like  center of an element, both 50% horizontally and 50% vertically and it can can accept one or two values, for sue the  three-dimensional transforms to work  need to know how its going to work how we want to transform it to make it done good for sure too we need to know the Perspective Depth Value to use it right in transform , for sure the rotate and translate , skew work on both dimensional (2,3) for sure we can add some style in it , there is some additions such as we can add animation,Transitions  to the element  so we can edit the appearns for the element , the transition is to change the position of the element  and give it other place maybe with other style  there is four properties that are related to it (transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.), we have to know in transtion property is very important to know what is the element we want to put on it , we should know that not all the properties can be transmitted  the trasmtion duration its measure in mlisecond, is it good thing to have attribute such as when you want to make the transition you can chose the time that you want to make the transition happen , for sure you can dely that transition too  , the css is very good because there is a lot of shorthand to write the codes  , to add the animation we have to add keyframe  what I mean about key frame is the steps and what will going on inside these steps where to move or who to transform the shape or what is the animation  for sure as we said there is time for it and delay  and we can repeat the iteration  or determine the direction there is many type of transition here are some of them ( Fade in,fade out ), we can do some colors and shrink or growth  may shadow.
