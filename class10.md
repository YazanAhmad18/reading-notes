## Readings : Debugging


## as we all know that javascript is not that easy , what is console its tool that help us to know where is error , we should all know that there is order of execution this will help us where is the error there is many type of context(GLOBAL CONTEXT,FUNCTION CONTEXT,EVAL CONTEXT (NOT SHOWN)),the global conext is the script that we can use it anywhere of the page ,function context it script that we use it inside the fucntion only ,eval conext is the script that we use function in other function  ,there is two scope for variables one is the global that we can use the variable everywhere , and other is function level scope this  variable we can only use it inside the  function, the javascript interpreter line by line at time but if there is fucntion need to call other code from other part  the interpreter stop at this line until the function do the job then get back to interpret the code line by line ,there are two phases to execute context first it is prepare socpe and function ,variables be prepared but all of this is going under somthing is call hoisting we can call the fucntion before we declare it because hoisting is make the declarationis up automatically,the second phase is execute the code , the scope is important concept in coding in this way we can undersand where we can use parts of the code  ,the error in javascript interpreter is call it exception we can find this error through console through error objects, there is types of error object(Syntax Error ,Ref erenceError ,Ev alError ,UR I Error ,Type Error ,RangeError ,Error ,NaN ), we can deal with the error in two ways debug the script and try to fix the errors ,handle errors gracefully, debugging we use the concept to flow up errors or any potential errors, first we see where is the problem then what is the problem ,we can look to the problem from chrome first right click on the screen then you chose inspect after this open the console, we use consloe log to put the data inside the console, we can stop the execution throught break points , the handle excption structure(try ,catch,finally)
