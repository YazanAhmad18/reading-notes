## css notes:
### there is an atribute that allow us to change the type of shape points this attribute call (list style type) or we can add image insted of points we use the attribute(list style image),we can also determine where can put the pointer outsite or inside (list style position) , lets talk about the properties that we can use at the table (width,padding,text-transform,letter-spacing,font-size,border-top, border-bottom,text-align,background-color,:hover) for sure there is more we can use i just mention some of them , there is property in the table we use it for show the empty cell or hide them , we can make gab between cells through properties such as (border-spacing,border-collapse),we can style text input through some properties such as (font-size,color,background-color,border,border-radius,:focus,:hover,background-image),also we can style submit button (color,text-shadow,border-bottom,background-color,:hover),there is many tpye of cursor such as (crosshair,pointer,move)


## javascirpt note : 
### lets talk about the event that happen on the website the event is that action happen on the website to do some function  to responde on the request of the user let me tell how its work first will happen interaction will be create with event this happen when user click button or somthing  like this to do function the second step is going to be the trigger that the event make the code ready to do the function then last step is responding to the user make the function successfully done ,there are many types of event (ui event,keybord event,mous event,foucs event, form event,mutation events),the event trigger the code or script,as we said before to make the event happen first we need to select node we want to make function then trigger it by the event after this will be stating the code to make it work , the event handler let you know which event will occurs and for which element going to happen there are tpyes of handler(HTML EVENT HANDLERS , TRADITIONAL DOM EVENT HANDLERS,DOM LEVEL 2 EVENT LISTENERS  ), the normal structure of the handler is (element.event=function),the event listener can handel more than one fucntion at time but they are not supported in old browser the structure of it (element.handler(event.function.event flow)),we use the anonymous function is to passing arguments to the handler or the listeners,event flow show us the fucntion goes through elements that are inside each other , the flow is very important when we have event handler, event object is telling all information about the event and what element happend on it , if we use one event listener  to more than one element it will slow down the page,the event objects have methods that can change the behavior.
